  The rainbow pride flag is a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer (LGBTQ) pride. This flag shows support and pride for anyone in the LGBTQ community. The colors on this flag represent 
Hot pink = Sex, Red = Life, Orange = Healing, Yellow = Sunlight, Green = Nature, Turquoise = Magic/Art, Indigo = Serenity, Violet = Spirit. The pink and turquoise were removed from the original flag because pink fabric was difficult to source and turquoise was removed so the flag would have an even number of stripes. Those changes left the flag with the colors red, orange, yellow, green, royal blue, and violet.
